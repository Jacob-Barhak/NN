This is code was written by Jacob Barhak as part of the Ph.D. thesis.
The code implements several types of self organizing Neural Networks for the purpose of reconstructing meshes from point clouds.
Some point cloud samples are provided in the samples directory.
The following publications use this code:
F. L. Krause, A. Fischer, N. Gross, J. Barhak, "Reconstruction of Freeform Objects with Arbitrary Topology Using Neural Networks and Subdivision Techniques", CIRP Annals, STC Dn, 52/1/2003, p.125, 2003. Online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60547-2
J. Barhak, "Reconstruction of Freeform Objects with Arbitrary Topology from Multi Range Images", Ph.D. Thesis, Mechanical Engineering faculty, Technion, Haifa, Israel, 2003. Seminar on the subject presented on October 24th 2002
